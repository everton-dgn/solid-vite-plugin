/**
 * Chrome Performance panel tracks, on by default under `vite dev`.
 *
 * `@solidjs/web/performance-tracks` paints Solid's records — re-runs,
 * interactions, holds, async flights, navigations, server-function calls —
 * as custom tracks in the Performance panel. It has to be enabled before
 * the app renders or hydrates for the first paint and the first
 * interaction to be on the timeline (and for the dev component wrapper to
 * capture each component's JSX site while an attribution engine is
 * installed), so the plugin injects a small virtual module that calls
 * `enablePerformanceTracks(<options>)` ahead of the client entry, the same
 * way the diagnostics bridge reaches the page:
 * - plain (index.html) apps: a `<script type="module">` prepended to
 *   `<head>` by `transformIndexHtml` (module scripts run in document order,
 *   so it evaluates before the app's own entry script);
 * - start mode: an import the generated client entry emits, or the
 *   authored client entry is given, ahead of every other import (see
 *   `src/ssr/index.ts`).
 *
 * Dev serve only, by decision: the tracks are a dev-server feature. Never
 * on `vite build` — not for `dev: true` builds, not for `observe` builds
 * (an observe app that wants tracks in production calls
 * `enablePerformanceTracks()` itself); never in test mode (vitest runs a
 * dev serve) or preview.
 *
 * The server needs nothing from this plugin: the dev server runtime writes
 * the request's timed work as `Server-Timing` metrics on its own
 * (`solid-shell`, `solid-boundary`, `solid-invocation` — `@solidjs/web`'s
 * `server.ts`, the trace context appended before the head freezes), and the
 * adapter in the page reads them back onto the `Server` track.
 *
 * `@solidjs/web` is the app's peer: the runtime import always resolves to
 * the app's own copy (the resolveId assist below), so the tracks share the
 * `@solidjs/signals` core the app renders with.
